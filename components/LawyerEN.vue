          1. The Kafala System

          It means that she’s registered under your name. Your name is on her
          work permit and residency permit, and the visa on her passport. She
          can’t switch jobs unless you agree, in the presence of a notary, to
          cede your responsibility of her over to another employer. You’re also
          responsible for renewing her papers every year and paying for her
          return airline ticket when she goes back to her home country. There
          was some talk a while back about abolishing the Kafala system so that
          domestic workers might be able to switch employers more easily, but it
          looks like the plans were stuck in a drawer somewhere until some
          undefined date.
        </p>

        <p style="direction: ltr" class="mt-5 text-left">
          <span class="font-bold">Q:</span> Does that mean I need to keep her
          passport with me?

        <p style="direction: ltr" class="mt-1 text-left">
          <span class="font-bold">A:</span>
          That’s the norm in Lebanon. Many employers never give their domestic
          workers access to their own papers, specifically their passports.
          Frankly, I don’t think there’s any need to withhold it, given that
          your name is on every single document related to her on file at the
          General Security. Meaning she can’t legally work anywhere else. And if
          she leaves your home, you report her to the security forces. It’s a
          way to pressure her, so she feels as though she has no choice but to
          remain with you. On the one hand, holding on to her passport can be
          considered an infringement on her personal freedom, which is
          punishable by the Penal Code. But as I said, confiscating a domestic
          worker’s passport is the norm in Lebanon, and no employer has ever
          been prosecuted for it. There have been several attempts to bring
          charges on this basis, but despite clear evidence of wrongdoing, no
          verdict has ever been issued against any employer. On the contrary, in
          one case, the judge ruled that the domestic worker had “stolen her own
          passport,” along with other items, from her employer. Another verdict
          held that there had been no crime because there was no criminal intent
          behind the employer’s withholding of the domestic worker’s passport.

          <span class="font-bold">Q:</span> What happens if I don’t renew her

          <span class="font-bold">A:</span>
          You pay a fine. And if someone asks to see her papers and her
          residency permit has expired, she is arrested and jailed unless she
          pays the required fees and fine.

          You have no criminal liability. And here’s where the inherent
          contradiction of the Kafala system becomes apparent. The sponsor is
          never punished. Even when they fail to renew the domestic worker’s
          paperwork with full knowledge of the fact that she doesn’t have the
          ability to renew them on her own so long as her papers are, as is the
          norm, in the sponsor’s possession. Even that the sponsor is expected
          to shoulder all the required costs for the paperwork and is
          responsible for renewing her work permit at the notary in order for
          any transaction to proceed.

          You report her immediately to the public prosecutor’s office in order
          to absolve yourself of any liability and for them to freeze her
          residency permit.

          <span class="font-bold">A:</span>
          There are studies indicating that there is one domestic worker suicide
          per week in Lebanon. Why? No one knows. In principle, there should
          always be an investigation carried out to determine the cause of
          death. To assess whether it was suicide or murder or even an
          incitement to commit suicide. But as is usual for Lebanon, the
          investigations aren’t carried out with any seriousness. Additionally,
          when it comes to suicide, there are issues to do with the repatriation
          of the corpse and with compensation. In most cases, the insurance
          required by the Ministry doesn’t cover cases of suicide.

        <p style="direction: ltr" class="mt-1 text-left">
          <span class="font-bold">A:</span>
          You have to take her to get tested for AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis,
          and possible pregnancy, either when she first arrives or when you’re
          finalizing her paperwork, that is, within the first three months of
          her arrival. These tests are, anyway, all requirements for the work
          permit. Then, you’re free to do as you please. There’s nothing
          stopping you from taking her to get tested periodically. But in the
          end, it’s her body, and she has the right to refuse any additional
          tests.

          <span class="font-bold">A:</span>
          You can call the police and ask that she be arrested if she assaults
          you in any way. People usually think about their own interests and try
          to solve the issue with the recruitment office. Now, mind you, the
          office doesn’t have any jurisdiction in this area, but it generally
          has the power to put pressure on the worker, and usually, they have
          someone there who understands and speaks her native language.
          Sometimes beatings are carried out at the office to teach her never to
          repeat the offense. This is, of course, against the law, and the
          people at the office can be prosecuted for it. But practice says
          otherwise. No office has ever been shut down or had its license
          revoked or its owner jailed for beating a domestic worker.

          <span class="font-bold">Q:</span> So, there’s a contract that should

          <span class="font-bold">A:</span>
          This is a standardized contract, which means you both need to sign it
          as is. You are, of course, free to give her more rights, such as
          higher wages, and can add these stipulations into the contract. But
          the notary will advise against it in order to spare you the higher
          fees required for making changes.

          <span class="font-bold">A:</span>
          She gets one day off a week. That means one day in which she gets to
          rest from work. But there’s nothing in the work contract to say that
          she has the right to leave the house on her days off. The contract
          also mentions six holidays a year. She doesn’t even know about any of
          this because the contract is written in Arabic. When the standard
          contract was first drawn up, it was supposed to be available in more
          than one language, but the way it’s done now saves employers extra
          costs.

          In principle, you can’t lock another person up; it’s considered an
          infringement on their personal liberty. But it’s become the norm in
          Lebanon. People are afraid their domestic workers will run away.

          Of course, there are no legal objections to bringing her along on
          visits. But it’s forbidden to put her to work in someone else’s home.
          That’s what it says in the contract. In terms of beach resorts and
          swimming pools, there’s been some talk of beach resorts that won’t
          allow domestic workers entrance. The issue is that they won’t allow
          her to enter to swim. She’s allowed to accompany the family in order
          to take care of the kids while they swim, but not to swim herself. In
          any case, this is an issue that’s in the Ministry of Tourism’s hands.

          It depends on the contract. You have to provide her with adequate
          housing as well as food and clothing. The General Security insists
          that this should be done inside your home, but this isn’t anywhere in
          writing.

          The insurance will cover emergency cases and hospitalization up to a
          certain limit. Insurance won’t cover vision and dental, and so these
          are your responsibility. In any case, there was some talk yet again
          recently that the Ministry of Labor was going to amend the contract so
          that it would be more in line with the conditions laid out in the
          International Labor Organization’s Convention on Domestic Workers,
          which Lebanon signed but did not ratify.

          If this happens during the 3-month probationary period, you can ask to
          have her replaced with another domestic worker. According to the
          contract, it is possible for either of you to submit a complaint to
          the Ministry of Labor, which will try to find an amicable solution to
          the problem. It is possible for either of you also to seek recourse
          with the law. The conditions for annulling the contract are the
          following: if she undertakes an act that harms you or a criminal act
          that is punishable by law. In this case, she shoulders the cost for
          her own airline ticket back to her country. Conversely, she can move
          to annul the contract if you fail to pay her for three consecutive
          months, or if she can prove that she’s been subjected to physical or
          psychological abuse, or if she’s being exploited and made to work
          another job. In these cases, you pay for her ticket back home. In most
          cases, people turn to the recruitment office for a quick solution even
          though legally, again, the office has no authority in this area. The
          other solution is to cede responsibility of her over to another
          employer.

          Security and deportation first, then the judiciary:
          <br />
          <br />
          After surveying a vast number of judicial rulings, it is apparent that
          the fate of the domestic worker is, in the vast majority of cases,
          decided by the security forces in coordination with the public
          prosecutors, who are content to simply uphold the work of the security
          forces without the judiciary having any active role, regardless of
          what might be actually just or fair. This became clear in several
          cases where domestic workers had left their place of employment and
          overstayed their residency periods. In these cases, after the women
          had already been arrested and interrogated by the Internal or General
          Security Forces, the public prosecutor’s office then okayed the arrest
          and turned the women over to the General Directorate of General
          Security so that they might decide on whether or not to issue
          deportation orders, provided that their files be turned over to the
          judiciary after that. Meaning that it’s the General Security that both
          decides whether to deport them or not and carries that decision out.
          Only then are their files referred to the judiciary. And then, the
          public prosecution sets in motion the strangest thing imaginable: the
          trial in absentia, that is, the domestic worker is tried without being
          present, in such a way that also absents her pain from the courtroom
          and all her suffering in all its forms.
        </div>

        <div class="p-4 mt-2 mb-5 text-left bg-gray-200">
          When the security forces and judiciary become tools to compel domestic
          workers to return to their work:

          <br />
          <br />
          Worse still is the persistence of this custom to mount an accusation
          of theft against domestic workers as soon as they leave their work, to
          ensure that the security forces move to arrest them. And it must be
          noted that, despite the proven defamatory nature of many of these
          cases, the practice continues within a broad field of tacit compliance
          from the security and the judiciary. The most dangerous thing about
          this practice is that in many cases, the threat of criminal
          proceedings became a way to coerce women to return to work under the
          pressure of possible arrest and deportation. This is aside from the
          fact that, unfortunately, the majority of judicial rulings until this
          day consist of a single page of prejudicial ideas bordering on
          outright racism and teeming with the word “escape” (we counted over 77
          verdicts that used this word): a word that connotes slavery. This in
          addition to many other examples of prejudice, such as referring to the
          women by nationality rather than name (for example, the Ethiopian or
          the Sri Lankan) and other such indications. Also significant is the
          absence of translators in many cases. Additionally, we note the
          limited nature of legal aid that is provided to the women, that is,
          the provision of lawyers to advocate for the workers’ rights or help
          defend them. This, in turn, leaves them vulnerable to yet more
          prejudice and abuse. It became in the woman’s best interest to accept
          the aforementioned return to her employer in order to avoid a worse
          fate—either deportation back to her home country along with all the
          disappointment and wasted investment that entails, or exposing herself
          to the risk of arrest and deportation at any time. Hence, faced with
          this reality, she often finds herself in a bind, caught within these
          constraints.

          <br />
          <br />
          We also came across other cases where employers accused their domestic
          workers of theft after she had left their employ. In these cases, the
          worker was arrested based on very flimsy evidence and then turned over
          to the judiciary charged with theft. In these instances, the General
          Security deported the women during the period of their trials without
          informing the judiciary. It is quite striking that in several similar
          court cases, the court in fact issued a verdict acquitting the woman
          of her crime, without that verdict of innocence affecting her fate in
          any way, given that she had already been detained for months and then
          deported—without ever receiving any compensation—as per a decision
          issued by the General Security. Moreover, it is most likely that the
          woman in question will never even know that she was officially
          acquitted of her crime. This same pattern is apparent in cases where
          the worker herself was the plaintiff. There are judicial cases upon
          cases piled up before the labor arbitration council, brought by
          numbers of workers demanding their wages or compensation due to abuse.
          However, it is noticeable that in every one of these cases, the worker
          had already been deported after her residency permit became invalid
          following her leaving her sponsor’s employ, while her case has
          remained open for years.
