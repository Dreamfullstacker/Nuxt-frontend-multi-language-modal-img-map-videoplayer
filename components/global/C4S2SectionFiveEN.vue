        Recently, academic scholarship on the Middle East has paid increasing
        attention to the topic of race and racism. As part of a global
        conversation about anti-blackness, a series of conferences,
        conversations, and public dialogues have emerged about the specific
        kinds of anti-blackness that characterize the modern Middle East, from
        Sudan to the Sahara, from Iran to Yemen. Among the questions being asked
        are: what is the status of seemingly racial terms like "abid" in
        different parts of the region? How have the experiences of ethnic
        minorities been marginalized because they do not fit the image of what
        it means to be, for example, Turkish or Kuwaiti? How do we acknowledge
        the importance of communities descended from slaves, or from earlier
        routes of trade and migration that predate modern nationalisms? Within
        these conversations, it has become increasingly evident that while we
        cannot simply apply Western frameworks of slavery, blackness, and white
        supremacy to the region, it is also important to recognize the active
        circulation of ideas that accompanied the movement of people and goods
        through European colonialism and global capitalism. Which is to say,
        while blackness does not mean the same thing in Lebanon and the United
        States, that does not mean there is no overlap.
