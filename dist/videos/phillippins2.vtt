Chapter 1
00:00:00.262 --> 00:00:03.262
Every 2 ½, 3 months I’d go to the Philippines.

Chapter 2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.809
My partner there, Miss Mary,

Chapter 3
00:00:08.827 --> 00:00:12.827
Would have set up trips for me to different islands,

Chapter 4
00:00:13.807 --> 00:00:14.807
Like Cebu,

Chapter 5
00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:20.175
I was so upset at what happened, all the dead,

Chapter 6
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.460
Cebu is one of the most beautiful places in the Philippines

Chapter 7
00:00:24.856 --> 00:00:26.856
And its people are known all over the country

Chapter 8
00:00:27.452 --> 00:00:28.952
When you say Cebu it means…

Chapter 9
00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:34.365
So, I’d go everywhere, interview people.

Chapter 10
00:00:35.121 --> 00:00:36.621
Mary was so clever,

Chapter 11
00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:39.167
she’d take advantage of the fact that I was going.

Chapter 12
00:00:39.948 --> 00:00:41.948
She’d buy ads there,

Chapter 13
00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:46.682
in the newspapers, the local radio, billboards.

Chapter 14
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.240
Saying this man is coming from Lebanon

Chapter 15
00:00:51.893 --> 00:00:54.393
looking to interview girls

Chapter 16
00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:58.533
for jobs in Lebanon, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, etc.

Chapter 17
00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.149
I’d be looking to recruit girls only for Lebanon!

Chapter 18
00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:02.435
But she was clever,

Chapter 19
00:01:02.826 --> 00:01:04.326
she’d make the most of it.

Chapter 20
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:06.331
I’d arrive around 5 am,

Chapter 21
00:01:06.408 --> 00:01:07.908
get picked up from the airport, and…

Chapter 22
00:01:09.864 --> 00:01:11.165
it was shocking.

Chapter 23
00:01:12.344 --> 00:01:15.844
There’d be 500-600 people in the street,

Chapter 24
00:01:17.322 --> 00:01:21.322
they’d give them seats, talk to them through loudspeakers.

Chapter 25
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:24.121
“The man just arrived.”

Chapter 26
00:01:24.878 --> 00:01:25.878
They’d take me up.

Chapter 27
00:01:28.378 --> 00:01:29.378
You’d feel….

Chapter 28
00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:32.795
I was really embarrassed by it.

Chapter 29
00:01:35.057 --> 00:01:36.057
All these women,

Chapter 30
00:01:36.757 --> 00:01:39.257
they’ll come up here one by one, to see you.

Chapter 31
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.650
I had a desk set up,

Chapter 32
00:01:40.686 --> 00:01:41.686
a secretary outside,

Chapter 33
00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:42.831
Piles of papers.

Chapter 34
00:01:42.887 --> 00:01:43.887
I have a notebook…

Chapter 35
00:01:44.269 --> 00:01:45.769
I should give it to you someday.

Chapter 36
00:01:47.444 --> 00:01:50.644
I wrote down all these little things

Chapter 37
00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.519
about this situation.

Chapter 38
00:01:53.743 --> 00:01:55.043
Each woman would come in…

Chapter 39
00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:56.179
Imagine her feelings,

Chapter 40
00:01:56.286 --> 00:01:59.786
coming to prove how good she is,

Chapter 41
00:02:00.242 --> 00:02:01.242
how educated.

Chapter 42
00:02:01.632 --> 00:02:02.632
You’d see women…

Chapter 43
00:02:03.808 --> 00:02:05.808
this one’s a criminologist,

Chapter 44
00:02:06.274 --> 00:02:07.774
this one’s specialized in…

Chapter 45
00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:09.725
They were a hundred times more educated than me.

Chapter 46
00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.460
Coming to apply, to interview with me

Chapter 47
00:02:13.568 --> 00:02:15.768
for jobs as domestic workers.

Chapter 48
00:02:17.305 --> 00:02:21.004
The Philippines is a country with good education

Chapter 49
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.979
good institutions,

Chapter 50
00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:24.979
intelligent, educated people,

Chapter 51
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.221
but no job opportunities.
