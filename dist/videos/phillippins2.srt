1
00:00:00,262 --> 00:00:03,262
Every 2 ½, 3 months I’d go to the Philippines.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,810
My partner there, Miss Mary,

3
00:00:08,828 --> 00:00:12,828
Would have set up trips for me to different islands, 

4
00:00:13,807 --> 00:00:14,807
Like Cebu,


5
00:00:15,675 --> 00:00:20,175
I was so upset at what happened, all the dead,

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,460
Cebu is one of the most beautiful places in the Philippines

7
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:26,856
And its people are known all over the country

8
00:00:27,453 --> 00:00:28,953
When you say Cebu it means…

9
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:34,365
So, I’d go everywhere, interview people.

10
00:00:35,122 --> 00:00:36,622
Mary was so clever,

11
00:00:37,168 --> 00:00:39,168
she’d take advantage of the fact that I was going.

12
00:00:39,948 --> 00:00:41,948
She’d buy ads there,

13
00:00:42,683 --> 00:00:46,683
in the newspapers, the local radio, billboards.

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,240
Saying this man is coming from Lebanon

15
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:54,393
looking to interview girls

16
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:58,533
for jobs in Lebanon, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, etc.

17
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,149
I’d be looking to recruit girls only for Lebanon! 

18
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,436
But she was clever,

19
00:01:02,827 --> 00:01:04,327
she’d make the most of it.

20
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:06,332
I’d arrive around 5 am,

21
00:01:06,408 --> 00:01:07,908
get picked up from the airport, and…

22
00:01:09,865 --> 00:01:11,165
it was shocking.


23
00:01:12,345 --> 00:01:15,845
There’d be 500-600 people in the street,

24
00:01:17,323 --> 00:01:21,323
they’d give them seats, talk to them through loudspeakers.


25
00:01:22,622 --> 00:01:24,122
“The man just arrived.”

26
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:25,878
They’d take me up.


27
00:01:28,378 --> 00:01:29,378
You’d feel….


28
00:01:31,295 --> 00:01:32,795
I was really embarrassed by it.

29
00:01:35,057 --> 00:01:36,057
All these women, 


30
00:01:36,757 --> 00:01:39,257
they’ll come up here one by one, to see you. 

31
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:40,651
I had a desk set up,

32
00:01:40,686 --> 00:01:41,686
a secretary outside,

33
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:42,831
Piles of papers.

34
00:01:42,887 --> 00:01:43,887
I have a notebook…

35
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:45,769
I should give it to you someday.

36
00:01:47,445 --> 00:01:50,645
I wrote down all these little things

37
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,519
about this situation.

38
00:01:53,744 --> 00:01:55,044
Each woman would come in…

39
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:56,179
Imagine her feelings,

40
00:01:56,286 --> 00:01:59,786
coming to prove how good she is,  

41
00:02:00,243 --> 00:02:01,243
how educated.

42
00:02:01,632 --> 00:02:02,632
You’d see women…


43
00:02:03,809 --> 00:02:05,809
this one’s a criminologist, 


44
00:02:06,274 --> 00:02:07,774
this one’s specialized in…


45
00:02:08,026 --> 00:02:09,726
They were a hundred times more educated than me.


46
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,460
Coming to apply, to interview with me


47
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:15,768
for jobs as domestic workers.


48
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:21,005
The Philippines is a country with good education

49
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,980
good institutions,


50
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,980
intelligent, educated people,


51
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:27,221
but no job opportunities.
