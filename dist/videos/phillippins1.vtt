Chapter 1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
So we went to the Philippines

Chapter 2
00:00:01.947 --> 00:00:03.947
I got numbers for the recruitment offices

Chapter 3
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.450
and went with a group of men.

Chapter 4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We had the name of a Palestinian there,
his uncle here gave us his contact.

Chapter 5
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.010
We checked into the hotel
and began calling the list of numbers

Chapter 6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.600
to meet the recruiters.

Chapter 7
00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:21.417
By this point I had a little English,

Chapter 8
00:00:22.073 --> 00:00:26.573
Though if someone hears me now they will laugh.
The way a Sri Lankan speaks Arabic,

Chapter 9
00:00:27.365 --> 00:00:29.865
my English is even worse.

Chapter 10
00:00:30.495 --> 00:00:33.994
So I would call the recruiters to meet,

Chapter 11
00:00:34.478 --> 00:00:37.609
they would tell us costs and wages.

Chapter 12
00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.670
Then this woman shows up,

Chapter 13
00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:42.055
a lady, very well put together.

Chapter 14
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.570
Joyful, talkative.

Chapter 15
00:00:46.987 --> 00:00:49.987
She invited me to her office the next day.

Chapter 16
00:00:51.296 --> 00:00:52.597
It was huge.

Chapter 17
00:00:52.991 --> 00:00:55.491
She had two whole buildings.

Chapter 18
00:00:56.683 --> 00:00:59.183
One was a training center.

Chapter 19
00:01:01.472 --> 00:01:03.972
She brought girls from the islands,

Chapter 20
00:01:04.495 --> 00:01:06.495
had them sleep there,

Chapter 21
00:01:07.263 --> 00:01:12.263
poor girls, like chickens in cages,

Chapter 22
00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:13.969
hundreds of them.

Chapter 23
00:01:14.396 --> 00:01:17.396
When I visited they would all stand up,

Chapter 24
00:01:18.037 --> 00:01:20.496
Yelling out, “good morning sir!”

Chapter 25
00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:22.371
A hundred voices shouting.

Chapter 26
00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:25.149
And you’d feel embarrassed…

Chapter 27
00:01:25.888 --> 00:01:31.188
She’d also train them there, teach them what to do. 

Chapter 28
00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:33.099
Before they traveled --

Chapter 29
00:01:33.368 --> 00:01:34.868
she had a very strong personality --

Chapter 30
00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:39.713
they’d pass by her office on the way to the airport,

Chapter 31
00:01:40.335 --> 00:01:44.335
and she’d give them a righteous lecture:

Chapter 32
00:01:44.918 --> 00:01:46.519
“You need to make the Philippines proud,

Chapter 33
00:01:47.022 --> 00:01:48.621
You need to be on your best behavior.”

Chapter 34
00:01:48.972 --> 00:01:49.972
Etcetera.

Chapter 35
00:01:51.207 --> 00:01:53.908
So we began working with this woman.

Chapter 36
00:01:54.682 --> 00:01:56.682
Her name was Mary Mi.

Chapter 37
00:01:57.703 --> 00:02:00.405
She sent us requests by the hundreds.
