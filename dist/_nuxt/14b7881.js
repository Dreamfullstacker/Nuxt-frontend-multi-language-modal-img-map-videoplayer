As part of a global\n      conversation about anti-blackness, a series of conferences,\n      conversations, and public dialogues have emerged about the specific\n      kinds of anti-blackness that characterize the modern Middle East, from\n      Sudan to the Sahara, from Iran to Yemen. Among the questions being asked\n      are: what is the status of seemingly racial terms like "abid" in\n      different parts of the region? How have the experiences of ethnic\n      minorities been marginalized because they do not fit the image of what\n      it means to be, for example, Turkish or Kuwaiti? How do we acknowledge\n      the importance of communities descended from slaves, or from earlier\n      routes of trade and migration that predate modern nationalisms? Within\n      these conversations, it has become increasingly evident that while we\n      cannot simply apply Western frameworks of slavery, blackness, and white\n      supremacy to the region, it is also important to recognize the active\n      circulation of ideas that accompanied the movement of people and goods\n      through European colonialism and global capitalism. Which is to say,\n      while blackness does not mean the same thing in Lebanon and the United\n      States, that does not mean there is no overlap.\n      '),t("button",{directives:[{name:"tippy",rawName:"v-tippy",value:{placement:"bottom",arrow:!0,arrowType:"round",animation:"fade"},expression:"{\n          placement: 'bottom',\n          arrow: true,\n          arrowType: 'round',\n          animation: 'fade',\n        }"}],staticClass:"underline font-nassimBold",staticStyle:{direction:"rtl"},attrs:{content:"In fact, I was surprised to learn that among black academics based in the United States, the kafala system in both the Gulf countries and Lebanon is regularly pointed to as a prime example of anti-blackness in the Middle East."}},[e._v("\n        [5]\n      ")])])])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);n.default=component.exports}}]);
