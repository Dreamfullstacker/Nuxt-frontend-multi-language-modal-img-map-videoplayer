It became, at this time, all the rage to have a “glassed-in” kitchen balcony, that is, to turn the small balcony off the kitchen into another room by enclosing it with glass panels that often included a window.

My friend Rayya explains:

<p class="flex mt-5 mr-5 sm:mr-20">
We bought our house in the Basta al-Tahta neighborhood when Ghassan and I got married in 1976. When we had children—we both worked—we decided to hire a worker to help us out. She was from Sri Lanka. Many people were employing domestic workers then because it was so cheap. But our apartment was small, with only two bedrooms, and there was no maid’s room. At the time, during the civil war, everyone around us had glassed-in balconies to increase their apartments’ space. So we enclosed our kitchen balcony, and this became the maid’s room. I don’t like what we did. But everyone took advantage of the war.
