From the day she died until today, I’ve been asking myself the same question: what killed Aiecha? The “coal stove” she took with her into her room? My parents, who brought her to our home and didn’t take enough care of her? Or the smallness of that room and the narrowness of its window?

I went into my mother’s room and opened the drawer where they kept all the official papers and family documents, looking for a floor plan for our apartment. I found it in a folder labeled: “Ramlet el Baida apartment, 1973:”

<p class="pl-10 pr-20 mt-5 pm-5">
Total square meterage of the apartment: 330 sqm; “maid’s room” area, 5 sqm.
</p>

<p class="mt-5">
The percentage occupied by Aiecha’s room of the total area of the apartment was 1.5%. The room was low-ceilinged, since the architect who had designed the place had put all the ventilation and water pipes above this room, the “maid’s room.”
