Ten years after her death, I enrolled at university to study architecture. In my second year of study or so, one of our professors took us on a field trip to an abandoned building in the Manara-Ain el Mreisseh neighborhood—a building considered to be an architectural gem, a perfect example of ‘50s modernism. The Duraffourd building, named after its owner, Galina Duraffourd.

As I wandered through the building’s apartments, I found a small set of stairs next to the kitchen. I went up and was surprised to find another floor there, a dingy, lightless, low-ceilinged mezzanine, barely two meters high, without any source of light. There were several small rooms up there, with a long corridor in between them that looked out onto the ventilation shaft. When I asked my professor about this, I learned that these were the servants’ quarters, including bedrooms and laundry rooms.
