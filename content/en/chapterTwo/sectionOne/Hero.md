chapterFirstParagraph: Architecture has always been a way to demonstrate and exercise power, and this is as true of our urban spaces as our domestic ones. The plans of the homes in which we live dictate which spaces are public, which private, which are “service areas,” and which are “leisure areas”. They organize our interior lives in subtle but powerful ways. In Lebanon, the presence of domestic workers in middle-class and upper-middle-class homes is now so prevalent, so institutionalized, that “maid’s rooms” are not only included as part of floor plans but also have their specs enshrined in the country’s building code.
chapterSecondParagraph: Here, too, is a history that has evolved over the course of the last century. As Lebanon’s capital experienced one construction boom after another, as class aspirations transformed and grew, as the domestic workforce shifted from people “like us” to “foreigners” from another culture, the maid’s room increasingly became a space designed to institutionalize the dehumanization of domestic workers. Spurred by a deeply personal motive, architect Abir Saksouk launches an investigation into the history of the maid’s room and how it became the invisible and suffocating place it is today.
