With the Levant’s entry into the capitalist system, 19th century Beirut transformed into an interior front connecting the sea and the mountain. The city quickly grew too large for the narrow confines of the old walls, expanding beyond them and becoming Beirut with the expansion and modernization of the port in 1894: the only sea route to the Syrian interior permitting the import and transport of European products (ref: Fawaz Traboulsi). The development of the port gave rise to a new class of merchants and commercial agents importing new, foreign goods—including for example, the Kettaneh family, who were cloth merchants, and who bought land on Mai Ziadeh Street in the Clemenceau neighborhood where they constructed residential buildings for the family.
