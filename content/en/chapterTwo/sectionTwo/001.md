The owner of the building explains:

<p class="flex mt-5 mr-5 sm:mr-20">
In the 1920s, we worked as cloth merchants, and our work took off. We were among the big merchant families of Beirut. We built this building in 1926. At the time, during the French mandate, there started to be buildings 3, 4 stories high owned by the big merchant families. It was a new and modern thing in Beirut. I remember we hired an Italian architect, and he’s the one who designed our building. The ceilings are high in the apartments, 4 meters high, and there’s a little attic over the kitchen to be used as a pantry, accessible with an iron ladder.

When we got a maid in the 1950s, we gave her the attic to sleep in, as many people did at the time. It’s true that it has a low ceiling, but it wasn’t a problem: the maids people hired back then were all quite young.
