Galina Duraffourd was a Russian woman whose father had worked at the Land Registry in Damascus under the administration of Camille Duraffourd, who began registering land in Syria and Lebanon with the beginning of the French mandate. Galina was hired as an accountant at the Land Registry, where she met her husband-to-be Camille. When her husband died in 1941, she held his position as administrator for 18 months, until a French expert delegation took it over from her (ref: George Arbid). During her time working at the Land Registry, she had built up a network of relationships that allowed her to work in the real estate development sector, from which she amassed a fortune. In 1945, Mrs. Duraffourd, along with the businessman Michel Zoghzoghi, established the Société Libanaise d'Amélioration Foncière (Lebanese Company for Real Estate Development), or SLAF.

Mrs. Duraffourd was also an active socialite, always invited to the big embassy parties and other significant events, and she helped launch the Baalbeck Festival.

SLAF realized a number of projects inside Beirut and outside it, in the city’s expanding suburbs, putting out advertisements for its residential projects in French-language magazines and newspapers, which give a good idea of the features of modernity and class aspirations of the time.
