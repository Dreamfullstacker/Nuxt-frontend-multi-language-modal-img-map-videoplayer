She knows all the intimacies of your life; she hears when you and your husband fight; she even knows when you and your husband have made love. She changes the sheets; she folds your underwear. She knows things about the kids that sometimes you don’t know. At the same time, she has to remain outside the family because otherwise, she would completely take over, and there would no longer be any room for you. There’s always a sense of competition. I’m not talking about competition over men; I’m talking about the actual competition between women, about who gets to run the house. Whose cooking is praised? Who do the kids listen to and run to for comfort? In very simple terms, she has to assume the role of the woman of the house so that you can actually get all the credit for it. And, of course, this is upsetting to her on some level. It’s upsetting to me that I have to rely on her for all that as well. Don’t think I don’t see the irony! I told you, I’m very smart about these things. About how relationships work between people. I wouldn’t be where I am in life if I wasn’t.
