Then we moved back to Beirut, and we got a much bigger house and had a second child, and then I really couldn’t manage on my own. There was no one I knew who didn’t have a maid and my friend recommended I go to the broker she had used. Of course, there’s an element of luck to it. You can have an excellent broker who hand-picks the girls, and you can spend hours going through the catalog to choose the exact right one, but the girls also lie sometimes. Not all of them, but some. Like they say they can speak a language when they hardly know a word of English or Arabic, or they say they have experienced when they barely know which side of a sponge to use. Sometimes they also have mental problems. The first girl we got seemed so sweet in her photo and so soft-spoken and polite when she first moved in. But she stared blankly like an imbecile every time I said anything to her, and she spent all night crying, no, I mean wailing, screaming in her room. And it was a really nice room, you know, we’d built it ourselves off the kitchen so she could have some privacy, and we made sure it had a good window. We gave her her own little TV and DVD player, things I’m sure she would have never dreamed of having back home. But some of them just aren’t right in the head. I felt it would be cruel to her and to us to keep her; I could never trust someone like that with my children anyway. I exchanged her, and we got Monica instead, and she was really the best maid anyone could ask for.
