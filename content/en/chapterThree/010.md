I’ve always been very grateful, don’t think I haven’t. I’m very fortunate to have had people to help me out. Besides the fact that our house is too big for one person to take care of on their own, I think I’d be very bored and unhappy if I were unable to work. I have a lot of ambition; I’ve climbed to the top in my company. Before the economic collapse, I was earning almost as much as Wael. But it will never not be strange having someone you don’t know living in your house. I would always wonder, what does she really feel or think about us? Who or what does she fantasize about? When I’d buy new lingerie, I’d imagine her folding it, putting it away. Was she ever tempted to try it on? To stand there looking at herself in the mirror? Did she ever look at Wael and imagine him making love to her? What kind of desires did she have? Maybe she fantasized about women; maybe she fantasized about me. I had no idea. You know, they know so much about us, and we know so little, so very little about them. And we need them and rely on them so much. Everyone thinks we’re the ones who have all the power, and in some ways, we do, but if they knew how much we needed them…. nothing would run without them; we wouldn’t be able to do anything. The whole country would collapse. If they knew how much we needed them, the tables would turn very fast, I assure you.
