The following is a monologue by Hala, delivered to a close female friend as they have an intimate coffee together. While Hala is a fictional character, her stories are based on actual interviews with women who have long histories of employing migrant domestic workers. These are educated, liberal, middle to upper-middle-class women who are fully aware that in order to fulfill their own dreams, they must hire someone else to assume the role of “the woman of the house.” However, they are usually unaware of what dreams this “replacement woman” might have for herself.
