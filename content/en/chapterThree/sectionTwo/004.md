She was from Sri Lanka, and she was smart. Not very educated, I don’t think she had more than brevet level, but smart in her way of dealing with people. I’m good at noticing these things, you know. I’m a manager of a big division at work, one of only two women in such a high position in my company. You have to figure out how to read people quickly, know how to flatter their egos. You have to be creative about how to exercise your power; you can’t just walk in there and start barking out orders, do this, do that, the way a man does. At the same time, you have to be very firm or else they walk all over you. So you give the employees some leeway as you tell them what needs to be done by such and such deadline and then they can decide the order of the tasks. I took the same approach with her, treating her like any other one of my employees. I’d say I need the windows done once a week and the floors and bathrooms done every day, etcetera. I insisted she stop work every day at 8 pm sharp and that she should take every Sunday off. Even when she would offer to stay home, saying she wanted to stay, I’d shoo her out the door. “Go! Socialize! Have fun, see people from your culture! We can manage without you for one day, I promise.”
