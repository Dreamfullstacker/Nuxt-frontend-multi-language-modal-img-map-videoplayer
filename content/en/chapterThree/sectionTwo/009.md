We’ve had a lot of maids come through our house. There was Lola, and she was Filipina, so well educated. She had a nursing degree! We had another Filipina after her, and then a Nepalese, I think—there was a while when there was a lot of Nepalese coming to work in this country. And then, at some point, there was Sara; she was Ethiopian. She had another name, but it was hard to pronounce, so we used to call her Sara. She was so dark. My god, she was almost blue; she was so black. Really a sight to behold. It surprised me because all the Ethiopians I’d ever seen were light brown and quite delicate featured—you know, they don’t even have those broad African noses. But she was so striking, and she could have been a model. Now they choose models based on how striking and odd they look. Have you noticed?
