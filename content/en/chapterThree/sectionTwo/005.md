Sometimes she’d try to manipulate me, to claim that I didn't tell her something when I knew very well that I had, or she’d try to rearrange the schedule, hoping I wouldn’t notice. I’d tell her, Monica, you can’t play dumb with me. I invented those tactics! And then we’d both start laughing. She had such a lovely, genuine laugh, and you felt it came from the heart. She could also be strict, though, which was very good for the kids. She kept them in line so well, like little soldiers; it was amazing. Some people don’t like the maids to discipline their children. Of course, I’d never let her hit them or really yell at them—she’d be out so fast she wouldn’t know what happened; I’d drag her out of the house by the hair! But imagine also leaving your kids with someone who has no authority over them. You’d come back to a mental hospital; you’d be raising monsters, and then guess who’s stuck dealing with them when the maid goes back to her own country?
