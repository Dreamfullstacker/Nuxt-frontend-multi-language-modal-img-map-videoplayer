My job was mainly in the office, welcoming clients and negotiating their needs as well as contracting new girls and communicating with my middlemen in the different regions from which we hired the girls. I had middlemen in Jabal Mohsen in Tripoli, in Akkar, and in Sir Daniyyeh, as well as in the Alawite mountains in Syria. It was nearly always fathers who brought their daughters to me, the same way my father had given me up to the orphanage 30 years earlier. Things had changed and become more formalized since then, however: a formal contract was always concluded between me and the father, valid for three years and renewable after that, giving me the exclusive right to place the girl with any family in Lebanon that needed a maid.
