These trips to Syria became especially necessary in the 1970s after Hafez al Assad came to power and enforced compulsory education for young girls and boys. In order to keep my business running, my well-connected brokers in Syria and I had to find solutions to bypass these laws, and so we started smuggling girls over the al-Kabir River at the border. I also enlarged my network in order to recruit more Kurdish and Egyptian girls, managing to maintain my numbers of new recruits and keep them as high as in the previous years.
