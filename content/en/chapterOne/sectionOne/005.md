I was one of five other maids in that household. Three of them were around my age; two were about seven years older. Most of these girls were from villages in the Keserwan area in North Lebanon. All of us shared one room in the villa’s basement, together with Fawzieh, the family’s cook, a woman in her late 40s. Fawzieh had been with this family since she was seven years old. Her status was special: on the one hand, she was sometimes counted and mentioned as a “member of the family,” occasionally sitting with them for morning coffee or going on day trips with them. On the other hand, she was also far more their property than any other one of us maids. While we at least didn’t know what our future might hold, hers was clear and inevitable: she would remain at work in the kitchen of that same family until she died. And indeed, Fawzieh did die in that house, in 1967, of a heart attack. She was actually buried in the graveyard adjacent to the family’s own plot.
