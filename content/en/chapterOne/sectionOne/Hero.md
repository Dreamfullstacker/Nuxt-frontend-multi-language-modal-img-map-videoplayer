chapterFirstParagraph: It is impossible today to imagine a Lebanese landscape that doesn’t include countless brokerage offices whose purpose is bringing domestic workers from Global South countries into Lebanon. These offices have formal licenses from the state to take hold of the entire process, from recruitment to travel arrangements to accommodations for the women when they first arrive. They are even asked to mediate conflicts between workers and their employers or to intervene when the law has to get involved for any reason. They exist, in short, to provide a supply for which there is great demand. They are the marketplace where the (entirely unequal) transaction between employer and worker takes place, and they also help shape the market for workers at large.
chapterSecondParagraph: 'But how did we come to this point? How did this market grow into what it is today, and how did the class profile of people hiring domestic workers expand so much? The history here is relayed through the first-person stories of two brokers: Salma and Zein. Together, their stories cover a timespan of a century, from the early 1920s—before Lebanon was an independent state and long before the existence of any official brokerage offices—until today. Through their eyes, we are provided a look not only at the country’s tumultuous history and rapid growth but also at the personal stakes involved for all of those who maintain the marketplace.'
