In 1958, after a short period of civil war and unrest, Fuad Chehab became the new president of Lebanon. His presidency heralded the beginning of a new era in Lebanon, an era of technocracy, modernization, and bureaucratization. The Chehabi era, too, saw a new phase in my own career as a businesswoman, for with the help of a distant relative of my mother’s who had gained a rather high position at the Ministry of Labour under the new government, I managed to register as an agent for domestic workers in Lebanon officially. In order to receive my official license, I had to deposit 10,000 LBP (approximately 3,000 USD) in the bank under the name of the Ministry of Labour. It was all the money I had managed to save over the course of my time working at the Pontifical Mission and running my maid’s business with Abou Loutfi. If my broker’s office shut down, I was told, the money would be returned to me.
