During my time working as a maid, I did see my biological family every now and then. Sometimes, my mother or my sister would visit on a Sunday; sometimes, I was allowed to go off with them for a couple of hours, either for a family lunch, a special event, or just some gathering. During these rare occasions, I felt strange and awkward, never really in the right place, and also constantly on the verge of leaving. I was always aware that these visits were temporary, lasting just for some hours, and that my place was somewhere else.
