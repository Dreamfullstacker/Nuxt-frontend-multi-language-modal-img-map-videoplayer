During the first ten years, my office was one of about 8 to 15 offices in Beirut, all of which had opened for business in the Chehabi era between 1958 and the early 1960s. The era of Chehabism had not only paved the way for the formalization of this registered business model, but, through its focus on modernization and bureaucratization, it had also created a new “expert” middle class: state officials employed in the newly expanding public sector, engineers, doctors, businessmen, and lawyers. All of them were in need of clean and functioning households, and most importantly, they could afford to hire servants to help them. Therefore, all the members of this class were potential clients for maid agencies, such as the one I ran in Badaro.
