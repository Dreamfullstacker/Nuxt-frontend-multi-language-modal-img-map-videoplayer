Through my work at the Pontifical Mission, I met Abou Elias and Loutfi, two co-workers who were in their late twenties at the time. About Elias was a Palestinian from Haifa, who, prior to 1948, had been a truck driver, shuttling goods and people back and forth between North Palestine and Lebanon, and so he had good relations established in Lebanon. Immediately after he fled Haifa in 1948, he found a job working at the Pontifical Mission. Loutfi was a Syrian man who had been born in Lebanon to a Lebanese mother and a Syrian father. His paternal family originally hailed from Beit Jinn, near the southern border of Lebanon. He was originally an Alawite who had embraced Christianity.
