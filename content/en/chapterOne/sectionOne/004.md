Over the next eight years, I would work in five different households in various areas in Beirut. It was always the nuns who took me from one household to another. I vividly remember the first house in which I worked. It was one of the villas in upper Ashrafiyeh with a garden. It had huge rooms, stained-glass windows, and high ceilings. The family quickly became fond of me because I was already tall and strong for my age, which was useful for the work I had to do: cleaning the house, carrying stuff, helping out in the kitchen, washing clothes, and tidying up. They called me “the tall one” and sometimes “tall Salma.”
