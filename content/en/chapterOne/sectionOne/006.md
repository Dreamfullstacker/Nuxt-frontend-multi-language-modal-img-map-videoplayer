The other maids were either like me, sent from one of the orphanages in Lebanon or had come directly from their home villages into the houses of the grand Beiruti families. Some kind of “broker” from Beirut, usually a person originating from the village, would pass by his “home village” asking poor families if they wanted to send their daughters to work in Beirut, saying he could facilitate the deal in exchange for a relatively small amount of money. Back in Beirut, he took the girls to the houses in need of maids—again in exchange for a sum of money. And with that, the trade was concluded. I remember one of these “brokers” passing by one of the houses in which I worked from time to time to check in on Mariam and Najah, two sisters from the village of Mayrouba in Keserwan who had been sent off to work by their family. About twice a year, the broker took them back to their family’s house for a visit.
