I was born in 1924 in Karantina in Beirut. My parents named me Salma after a maternal aunt who had passed away when she was only five years old. I was the second of six children. My father worked as a carrier in the Beirut port. He was born and raised in a small village in South Lebanon. His father, my grandfather, was a tobacco farmer. When my father was 16 years old, he moved to Beirut, searching for any job that could earn him a living. Through a distant relative, he found work at the Beirut port. At the age of 18, he married his maternal cousin, who was 17 at that time. The newlywed couple moved into a small shack in Karantina, close to the port. All my siblings and I were born and raised there.
