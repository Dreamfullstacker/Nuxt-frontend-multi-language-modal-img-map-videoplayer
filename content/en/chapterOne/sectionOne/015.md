This was a period of modernization and development for Beirut, largely thanks to the expansion of the port, and the city suddenly saw a growing middle and upper class, all in need of household help. In 1952, Abou Elias left the Pontifical Mission and started working with UNRWA. And so Loutfi and I alone continued the business of bringing girls from poor Syrian families to work in Beirut. We were called samasira (agents), while the girls were often referred to as lafaya (i.e., belonging to; affiliated with). The girls we placed into rich families were rather young, in keeping with people’s preferences for housemaids who were on average between the ages of 7 and 12. Young girls were hardly noticed; they rarely caused problems and were easier to control—and I had learned all this from my own experience working as a maid.
