There were countless people in dire need, not just the tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees who had arrived in Lebanon with nothing but a few belongings begging for some help. Loutfi also knew of many poor Syrian families living in Lebanon. And so Loutfi, Abou Elias, and I began working together to make arrangements for the families in need, offering to find their minor daughters work as maids in the houses of the rich. That’s how we began working as brokers, placing young girls as domestic servants with well-to-do Lebanese families. They were mainly girls from the Alawite Mountains in Syria and some from the newly-established Palestinian camps in Lebanon. We continued working for the Pontifical Mission while on the side operating our “grey market” business with the maids out of the same office. Indeed, the wide network of connections we’d built with rich people through our work at the mission was of great benefit to our work as brokers.
