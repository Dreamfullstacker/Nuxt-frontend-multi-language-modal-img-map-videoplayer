Over the course of all those years, I learned to be a good maid. I was physically tall and strong, and I was obedient to my superiors, cleverly fulfilling my tasks and role. I also developed a good sense of resilience and calm that helped me adapt to all the different households and circumstances I encountered during these years. I learned how to become just like the people I worked for: how to talk like them, behave like them, look at things like them, solve problems like them. I distanced myself more and more from my own family background. They still called me “tall Salma,” often continuing the sentence with “our good, strong maid.” Two of the convent’s nuns regularly visited the house where I worked, checking on us maids and helping solve any problems that arose. Because they never heard any complaints about me, they began entrusting me with the responsibility of solving small problems in the house myself—mediating any disagreements between us maids, for example, or between the family and the maids. Ensuring that the maids’ presence in the house was smooth and pleasant for everyone meant the continuation of the business for the nuns, a business that didn’t provide them with direct financial compensation but assured them donations and privileges from the rich in exchange for a supply of good maids. I fulfilled my role well, again relying on my good sense of balance: keeping a close eye on everything happening in the house yet always while attempting to remain invisible.
