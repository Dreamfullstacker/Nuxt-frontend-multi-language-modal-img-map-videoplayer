By the time I was 16 years old, I had already been working as a maid for seven years in five different households. I had moved from Ashrafiyeh to Ras el Naba’, then to Qoraytem, then back to Ashrafiyeh once again. When the Israeli state was formed in 1948, around 100,000 Palestinians fled to Lebanon, seeking refuge from the horrors of the Nakba. A Pontifical Mission was set up to help the new arrivals. Because of my good relations with the nuns, they offered me a job at the Mission, working on packaging and distributing aid to Palestinian refugees.

I made a good living working there, and it was also a job in line with the values and ideas I had learned from the nuns: that helping others and engaging in charity work was and should remain one of the core activities of my life. That’s when I began finding a new place for myself in Beiruti society.
