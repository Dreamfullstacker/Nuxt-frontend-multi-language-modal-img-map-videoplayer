The business was going so well that in 1966 I opened two other small offices close to Badaro, run by two of my nephews. These were my golden years. I had relations and connections with people from all walks of society, including with high state officials who were all dependent on me to find them young girls to work in their houses. Through these relations, I was also able to help my relatives get into positions within the military or government or help facilitate the running of their own businesses and companies.
