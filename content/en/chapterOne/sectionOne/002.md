When I was nine years old, in 1933, my father decided to send me to an orphanage. He had sent my older brother to go work with our grandfather in the tobacco fields and now decided that it was time to find a solution for his eldest daughter as well. At the time, it was common practice for poor families to send their children, especially if they were girls, to orphanages, even if the parents were still alive. These were always purely economic decisions. The orphanage they took me to was the Azariyeh convent in downtown Beirut, and the conventâ€™s nuns ran it.
