I rented a small office in the East Beirut neighborhood of Badaro, an upper-class residential area, and seat of many state institutions. I officially started to hire out Lebanese, Palestinian, Syrian, and Egyptian girls to work as domestic servants in the homes of Lebanese families. Over the course of the following years, my business flourished, and my network expanded. I was hiring out between five to ten thousand girls a year. My job wasnâ€™t always easy; I had many challenges come up, sometimes with state officials, sometimes with the girls, or with the families who had hired them. I usually solved these problems myself, very often through endless negotiations and financial compensation, no matter the incident.
