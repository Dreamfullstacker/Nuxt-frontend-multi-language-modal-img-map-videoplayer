Salma worked as a house servant for 15 years, beginning at the age of nine. In 1958, she opened her own domestic worker’s employment agency on Badaro Street in Beirut. Her story was recounted to us by one of her nephews. But the narrative below also weaves in elements from various accounts of other former agents for domestic workers, as well as from stories of Lebanese women who were once domestic workers themselves during that same time period. As such, Salma’s story is also that of the transformation of the domestic workers’ market, from something more disorganized, dependent on informal social ties (which here include some religious organizations), to a more “official” market, with all relationships mediated through brokerage agencies which were legalized at the end of the 1950s.
