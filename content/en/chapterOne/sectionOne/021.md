Although the day-to-day business took up most of my time, it was still necessary for me to travel to Syria every now and then in order to keep an eye on my business there, to engage directly with the middlemen I had in the villages, and discover new villages for the potential recruitment of girls. I usually traveled to Homs, where I spent the night at the home of one of my “middle women,” Imm Samih, continuing from there into the Alawite mountains and then on to Aleppo. I recruited girls from Aleppo who were skilled at cooking the famous dishes of their hometown.
