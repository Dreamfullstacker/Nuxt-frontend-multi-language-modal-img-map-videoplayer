My business only began to fall apart after 1975, when the civil war in Lebanon broke out. People started to become touchy about questions of a religious sect and were more hostile to people with Syrian or Palestinian nationalities. Families were unlikely to employ someone of another religious sect, let alone a Syrian or Palestinian girl. Soon a new market in the maid business opened up, increasingly relying on the recruitment of girls from Asian countries, such as Sri Lanka. My business declined rather suddenly, and by 1977 I could no longer sustain my three offices. I sold off all three of them and lived another ten years in Badaro, where I had bought myself a house in 1962. I died in 1985.
