There was only one girl I remember who was in fact, an orphan, or at least she knew nothing about her father and mother. She was also not registered and therefore had no legal papers. We worked in the same house for a time before she escaped and was never heard from again. She was 15 at the time. Rumour had it that she had run away with one of the guys who delivered vegetables to our house and that she had ended up working as a prostitute and abusing drugs.
