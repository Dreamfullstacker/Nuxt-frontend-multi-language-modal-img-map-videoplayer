My stay at Azariyeh was a short one. After one month, the nuns decided to send me away again: this time to work as a maid in one of the rich peopleâ€™s houses in Beirut. Again, this was the fate of many; a lot of orphaned, or not-orphaned, girls who stayed with the nuns were sent to work as maids, especially if they were between the ages of 7 and 12. Due to their well-connected position in Beiruti society, it was easy for the nuns to find families who were in need of a maid. It was a double trade agreement: my parents had given me away so as to no longer be accountable for keeping me alive, and the orphanage had given me away so as to have one less mouth to feed. This did not mean that the nuns were no longer responsible for me; they gave me away like an object on lease while keeping a close watch on what I was doing and where I was working.
