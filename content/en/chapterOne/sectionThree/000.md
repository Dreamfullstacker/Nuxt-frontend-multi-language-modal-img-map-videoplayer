To illustrate the thousand ills of the Kafala System, we, along with the lawyer Nizar Saghiyeh, came up with a character we named Layla. Layla is in her thirties, born and raised in Beirut. For years, Layla refused to have a domestic worker, but after she had her second child, she decided to hire someone to “help out” at home.
