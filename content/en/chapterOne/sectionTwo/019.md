Ms. Mary then launched a website, where she shared photos of prospective domestic workers who were ready to travel and work outside the Philippines. Each woman had a number attached to her name, so that potential clients browsing the site could look up further information about each woman and then call up Zain’s office, give him the number of the woman they’d chosen and recruit a new domestic worker without ever having had to set foot outside their homes. Zain would then email Ms. Mary’s office and ask them to get all the paperwork ready to arrange travel for the chosen woman. A few days later, she would arrive promptly at Beirut airport. And that’s how Zain’s office came to be receiving no less than ten demands a day from customers looking to employ a Filipino domestic worker. After having paid all the costs related to bringing them to Lebanon, he made 250 dollars of pure profit per woman he recruited, which meant he was making about 40 to 50 thousand dollars of profit per month. In the first two or three years of the new millennium, Zain had managed to amass considerable wealth, completely overhauling every aspect of his life, both materially and otherwise.
