Zain, his brothers, and his cousin prepared all the documents necessary to establish a commercial register for a recruitment and employment agency for foreign domestic workers. The permit was processed and signed within a day of its being issued thanks to their relative, the minister. In fact, the license became operational before the brothers, and their cousin even understood how to sort out the very first orders of their business, so they quickly took to trying to familiarize themselves with all the steps and procedures involved in bringing women over from Sri Lanka.

In the course of his research, Zain met a man who ran an employment agency for domestic workers and ended up accompanying the man on a trip to Colombo, Sri Lanka, in 1996. It was the first time heâ€™d ever set foot in an airport, and he was, at that point, as ignorant of everything to do with travel as he was of the English language, the lingua franca necessary for him in order to communicate with the contacts he was supposed to meet in Sri Lanka. On both his first and second visits to the country, he behaved more like someone humorously playing a part without believing it was truly his to play.
