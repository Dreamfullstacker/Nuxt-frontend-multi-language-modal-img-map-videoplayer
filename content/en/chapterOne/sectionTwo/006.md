He went on to rent a small office space for his new work on the ground floor of a building in the Beer al-Abed area, not too far from the auto body shop, in the same building where his aunt lived on the first floor. At first, he didn’t get a phone line for his office and would instead direct people who wanted to do business with him to call him at his aunt’s, who would step out onto the balcony and yell out for him to come upstairs and take the call. He spent long hours every day sat behind his desk, engrossed in reading the newspaper, which he bought every day without fail as he considered it one of the indispensable tools required for his new job, just like his new clothes, which no longer had grease stains on them from the auto shop. This relieved his mother of the task of having to launder all those stains from his clothes and the clothes of his two brothers, who had also abandoned that line of work. The auto body shop, however, continued to operate, run by Zain’s father and two of his other sons.
