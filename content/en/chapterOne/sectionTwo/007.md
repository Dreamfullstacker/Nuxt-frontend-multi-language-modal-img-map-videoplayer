The number of extended family members granted permits by the minister of Labor to open up their own recruitment and employment agencies for foreign domestic workers multiplied, and soon there were a number of new offices springing up in Beirut and its southern suburbs. The paperwork required to recruit and employ a foreign domestic worker was relatively minimal and easy to obtain, as was the cost of the whole procedure. There was a network of Lebanese and Sri Lankan recruiters working together in Sri Lanka to obtain entry visas from the Lebanese embassy in Colombo for domestic workers seeking to come to Lebanon, while in Lebanon, the agencies would prepare all the paperwork required by the Ministry of Labor in order to secure employment for the women upon arrival in the country. In addition to the price of the one-way flight ticket to Beirut, the cost of bringing one domestic worker into the country in the mid-90s was somewhere between 400 and 500 dollars. The agency in Beirut charged their customers between 800 and 900 dollars upfront for each woman they brought in to work in their household, and households were expected to provide a salary of 80 to 100 dollars per month for their live-in maids. At the time, the Ministry of Labor did not yet require work permits for the women, nor any residency permits from the Directorate of General Security. The vast majority of the foreign domestic workers in Lebanon hailed from Sri Lanka.
