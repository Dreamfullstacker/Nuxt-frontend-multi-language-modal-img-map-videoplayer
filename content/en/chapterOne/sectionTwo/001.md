Zain was born in 1965, a son of his father’s first marriage. Married twice, Zain’s father sired 11 children in total, eight boys and three girls, all of them born in Shaqra. Zain attended the same village school like all the rest of his siblings, making it to the third grade before the first large-scale Israeli military campaign on South Lebanon began in the spring of 1978. Seeking to neutralize the Palestinian Fedayeen, the Israeli army invaded Lebanon all the way up to the Litani river to oust their headquarters, bases, and camps.
