Once, one woman was sexually assaulted in a cab at night, and seeing an army checkpoint, opened up the door and flung herself from the vehicle, screaming at the top of her lungs and running for safety. She was taken by the soldiers, along with the driver of the car, to the police station, who then called the agency to come handle it. That specific time, when Zain arrived at the police station, he found the driver’s immediate and extended family all waiting for him there, as well as the forensic doctor who had examined the woman. He was given 500 dollars in exchange for his “trouble,” while the police were given 400 dollars by the driver’s family as a bribe, and the woman was asked to pay 500 dollars in order to secure travel for her back to her home country. After she paid the money, Zain handed her over to the agency so they could take care of the rest. When a domestic worker is sexually assaulted, or another commits suicide at the home of her employer, then the employers call the agency so they can follow up on these incidents, saying: please fix this. We have a family and children.
