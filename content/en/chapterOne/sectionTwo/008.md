Zain, his brothers, and his cousin gradually came to learn the “secrets of the trade” as they worked in their small office in the Beer al-Abed neighborhood, earning enough income to rent another, bigger office space on the second floor of a brand new building on Mouawad Street, which not only boasted a “chic” market for ready-to wear clothing boutiques but had also generally become known as one of the more upscale neighborhoods in the Southern suburbs in the years after the war. However, shortly after they opened the bigger office, Zain’s cousin decided to leave the business and traveled to Germany to work in the used car business. The brothers thus found themselves alone when suddenly, in 1997, they had to contend with the emergence of a new law that forced brokerage agencies like theirs to deposit 50 million Lebanese lira (at the time, equivalent to about 33,000 US dollars) in trust at the Central Housing Iskan bank to continue operating, or else they would have their permits revoked.
