All right then, weâ€™ll move on to Ethiopia, Bangladesh, and the Philippines thought Zain. But the minute he began looking into the Lebanese-Ethiopian-Bangladeshi-Philippine brokerage market and agencies, he realized there was a monopolistic turf war going on between the powerful and the influential. As such, it was a market difficult to penetrate. Not only that: the brokerage network and its turf war went all the way up into the official governmental circles and institutions actively responsible for administering the transactions related to foreign domestic work in Lebanon, the Philippines, and Ethiopia. The Foreign Minister of Ethiopia, for example, was the second most powerful person in the government. He had a whole network of brokers who loyally answered to him, who were themselves part of a network of agencies dedicated to recruiting women for domestic work abroad, and he pocketed 100 dollars in return for every travel authorization signature he gave out. In Bangladesh, there were 3 or 4 people authorized to sign for travel facilitation, and each of them, as well, charged 100 dollars for every case they approved.
