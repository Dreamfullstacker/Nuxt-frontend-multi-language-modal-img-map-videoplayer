Zain also expanded his work to include women from India, after a chance encounter with an Indian man in Beirut. Together, they decided they could work to promote the idea of Indian domestic workers coming to Lebanon. The Indian man went back to his native land and got his hands on a number of passports from his fellow countrywomen, charging each of them a certain amount of money in order to facilitate their travel to Lebanon. When Zain visited India himself, his colleague over there handed him copies of hundreds of passports belonging to Indian women. However, the women who arrived at the airport in Beirut—and whom Zain went to pick up—were not all the same women whose passport copies Zain had brought back with him from India. And so, there were quite a number of women who ended up working in homes in Beirut under false identities, under passports belonging to different women. Zain pocketed 200-300 dollars more for each Indian woman he managed to employ, in comparison to the amount he usually made from employing Sri Lankans. Indians, in his estimation, had stronger personalities and were more assertive both in general and in their work. Based on this, some of his clients indicated a preference for an Indian woman, especially that the Lebanese always wished to remain fashionable and exceptional in every choice they made. The Indian authorities, however, quickly put a stop to the whole business, intervening to forbid Indian women from traveling abroad to find domestic work.
