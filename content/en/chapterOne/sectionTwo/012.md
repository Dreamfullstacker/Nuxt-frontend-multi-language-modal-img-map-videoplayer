title: The Market and its “Trends”
---

For the first twelve years, the work of recruiting and employing foreign domestic workers from Sri Lanka was easy and profitable, says Zain. But he had to find ways to evolve and expand his work by bringing in workers from Ethiopia, Bangladesh and the Philippines, responding to the fluctuations of the market as well as the Lebanese themselves, whose moods, wishes, and desires oscillated wildly as they competed with one another, struggling to stay ahead of the curve. The Lebanese employed women based on trends and fashion and based on their perceived social rank and what they imagined this social rank required by way of a suitable choice of a maid. For the maid’s nationality was a reflection of the social standing of her employer. While Sri Lankan women were the most available on the Lebanese domestic labor market since having begun arriving in the mid-1980s, people in certain circles and environments began favoring women from Ethiopia and the Philippines instead. Despite this, many Lebanese domestic workers hailed from either Ethiopia or the Philippines continued to refer to them as “Sri Lankans” since the nationality itself had become synonymous with domestic work. And so, when some Lebanese wish to declare that they have a domestic worker at home, they will often be heard to say: “I have a Sri Lankan.”
