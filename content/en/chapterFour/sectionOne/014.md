This seemingly hidden power did not only play out in these silent questions. It started to become a reality in our encounters and communications. Within our group, power and privilege started to become visible, tangible and more and more difficult to ignore and overcome. The idea of the project was to join forces in order to represent and to resist together – an idea, a struggle, a feeling. The migrant domestic workers who had approached had been activists for their own rights for years. They stood up to speak and to represent themselves, to resist and protest. Like us in many ways. Strangely enough, our power started to become visible mainly when the others started to resist against it. Small and multiple incidents like them complaining about the weekly food we had organized, excluding us from their meetings, criticizing us for our decisions, disagreeing with us, not cleaning up after the meetings in our premises– normal incidents of conflict in group settings, but within these dynamics, they created a guilty silence among us, a notion of denial, of silence and silencing, filled by the inevitable but equally denied question of dominance and representation. Can the subaltern speak? Is she allowed to speak? Who represents? Who dominates?
