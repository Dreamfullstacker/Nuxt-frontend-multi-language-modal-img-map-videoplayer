Another migrant domestic worker, considerably older than 60, lost her job with a Lebanese family rather suddenly. She had to move out of the family’s house, and was from that moment not only without a salary but also without a roof over her head, staying with friends and with whoever gave her a place for a while. She is still in this situation. A third one had to leave her nine-year-old daughter alone in her apartment after school because the lady she was working for during the day did not want a child in her house. Sometimes she had to sleep at her employer’s house and therefore leave her daughter alone all night.
