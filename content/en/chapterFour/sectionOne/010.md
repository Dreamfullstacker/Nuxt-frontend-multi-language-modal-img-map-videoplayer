The project took place nearly every Sunday for about 4-5 hours. It included a joint lunch, theatre activities, discussions, and workshops. All in all, it included about 30 persons, five “Lebanese,” and about 25 migrant domestic workers from different backgrounds. I remember after one of the sessions, a friend of mine who I had just integrated into the project wrote me a text message: “I wanted to tell you how much the meeting yesterday made me miss New York and all the diversity there.” I answered, “Yes, I can imagine. I loved the energy as well.” There is a lot of truth in the moment to this. The project meetings had an incredibly good energy and atmosphere. Everyone seemed happy, was loud and emotional, creating an us-space and an us-experience. Without a doubt, the migrant domestic workers enjoyed these meetings; they were grateful for the project and it gave them a space to relax, to exchange, and to express themselves. Likewise, we felt good; the project gave us new insights, new ideas, new friends, and Lebenswelten.
