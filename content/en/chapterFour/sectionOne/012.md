A black person can easily be referred to as ‘abd, a “slave,” in a normal family conversation in Lebanon, usually, but not exclusively, by someone who is one generation older. We all have friends and relatives who do not give their “maid” the right to a day off or who make them sleep on the balcony. We hear awkward comments about those maids all the time (even within our friends’ and relatives’ circles), and we witness discrimination and abusive behavior against them on a near-daily basis on the streets and in public life. This is a different story; a story about attempts to form alliances, of solidarity and friendship, and about the unsaid within these relations and attempts. This is not a judgment or a (self-)accusation. This is also not to question the good intentions among everyone involved, those who started this project and still keep it going. This is rather about the silenced and denied power dynamics and ambivalence inherent in the encounters between “black subalterns” and “white elite”.
