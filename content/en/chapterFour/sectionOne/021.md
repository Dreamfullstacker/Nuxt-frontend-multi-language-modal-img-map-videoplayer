The devil lies – as usual – in the detail and visible only once we decide to not overlook it. The joint Sundays could not cover the differences in lifestyle, routines, challenges and problems that they and we were facing. They could likewise not cover the mutual dependencies and relations we had within these differences outside of our Sunday world. While we were doing the project, the husband of one of the migrant domestic workers died of a sudden heart attack in the Philippines. She not only had to borrow money to take a plane to his funeral but also to pay his outstanding hospital bills of about 6,000 USD. She was gone for 20 days, coming back as a widow and leaving behind her two teenage sons who needed her financial support and her comfort. She had to work to sustain their studies and their livelihood, talk to them daily to help them overcome their father’s death while she herself mourned a man she had hardly lived with but who had raised their two children alone while she was working in Lebanon. She had to pay back her debts.
