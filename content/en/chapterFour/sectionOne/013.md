Not only did the Lebanese context and its cruel decision to leave migrant domestic workers from African or Southeast Asian countries without rights or societal access play out within the project, but our own power dynamics also snuck in and slowly consolidated themselves within our encounters. At first, the questions were only in my own head: “Who is talking in the meetings?”, “Who sets the agenda?” “Am I respectful enough?” “Are we listening to them enough?” “How do we approach class issues and problems? “How far do we enter their reality?” “How different is it from ours?” “How far do we talk about our mutual dependencies, our common history?” Last but not least, “How far do we voice the fact that they are black and we are white?” We are white Lebanese, not only privileged in our choices and facilities but, on a much deeper level, we have the entitlement to ask these questions, we decide what is wrong or right, it is us who own a form of collective power, us who define what needs to be represented and what form of music the piano can play.
