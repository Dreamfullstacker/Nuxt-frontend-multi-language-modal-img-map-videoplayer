How did this make me feel? Shameful? Helpless? Guilty? Powerless? At times angry? Yeah, all of it, sometimes more, sometimes less. I tried to overcome it, to show my empathy, my pity and my solidarity, I tried to help. But I also tried to deny, to not listen, to forget and to stop my thoughts from going down the path of questioning how these women must feel when they see my life and me. They must feel so angry, so hateful, and so powerless given my privileges and my rights. But there was more to it than just these differences. They existed in a mutual relationship outside of the context in which we decided to join forces. Outside of this context we are totally dependent on their cheap, invisible and uncomplicated workforce; they are totally dependent on us in giving them this workforce and in using our power to be nice to them. Not only are some of the women actually cleaning the houses of people we know and taking care of children we know, they are also a vital part of how our society functions and of how we enjoy lots of our privileges. At the same time, they are dependent on our goodwill, our good intentions â€“ be it as their employers, as their kafeels, their donors, project partners or even their friends.
