Approximately one year ago, a group of migrant domestic workers approached me with a project they wanted to implement: a day-care center for migrant domestic workers’ children and a meeting center in one of Beirut’s suburbs. They were looking for funding, and I was working for a potential donor. The project did not work out; our funding priorities were different ones, but we continued the conversation, deciding to do some workshops together and to think about other projects. We started a fruitful cooperation, different projects, hopefully, and slightly naively, contemplating what we could achieve in Lebanon. Much of this initial enthusiasm faded with time, and the project had challenges and limits that we had turned a blind eye to in the beginning.
