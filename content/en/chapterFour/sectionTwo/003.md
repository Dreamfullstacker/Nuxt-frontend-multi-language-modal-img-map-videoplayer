Consider the following questions. Are the Lebanese white? Are all Lebanese white? What about other Arabs? Are Syrians and Palestinians black in Lebanon, but white in Syria and Palestine? Are Filipinas whiter than Sri Lankans, and are Ethiopians blacker than Bangladeshis? Why does the form used by Zain's office to describe Sri Lankan domestic workers to potential employers first list skin color as a relevant feature of their employability, and then describe certain Sri Lankan women as "Fair"? Is a tanned Lebanese Madame darker-skinned than a "Fair" Sri Lankan domestic worker? What is the relationship here between Fair and Dark; Brown and Black; Asian and African; Madame and Maid; Arab and White?
