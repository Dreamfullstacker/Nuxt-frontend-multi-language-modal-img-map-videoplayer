How, then, do we tell the story of race and kafala in Lebanon? One version of this story would explain the spectacular violence experienced by migrant domestic workers in the country through the simple fact of racism. Here, racism is understood to refer to discrimination and violence perpetrated based on skin color. After all, the kafala system is one in which it has become possible for black and brown women to be confined to attics and kitchen pantries, for the fridge to be locked, for pieces of bread to be counted, for hands to be tied with electric cables, and for all this to be done to the very same women who are asked to cook the food, change the bedsheets, change the children's diapers, and bathe the elderly parents of those who are marked as having lighter skin. But I want to propose a different approach. A better way to understand the difference between "black" and "white" is to recognize that race is neither natural, nor is racism an explanation for bad behaviour. Instead, both race and racism are what social scientists refer to as socially constructed; things that are situated in historic, political, and economic processes.
