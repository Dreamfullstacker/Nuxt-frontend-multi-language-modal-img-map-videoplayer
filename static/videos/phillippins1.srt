1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
So we went to the Philippines


2
00:00:01,947 --> 00:00:03,947
I got numbers for the recruitment offices 


3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,450
and went with a group of men.


4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We had the name of a Palestinian there,
his uncle here gave us his contact.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:17,010
We checked into the hotel
and began calling the list of numbers

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,600
to meet the recruiters.

7
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:21,417
By this point I had a little English,

8
00:00:22,073 --> 00:00:26,573
Though if someone hears me now they’ll laugh.
The way a Sri Lankan speaks Arabic,

9
00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:29,866
my English is even worse.

10
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:33,995
So I’d call the recruiters to meet,

11
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,609
they’d tell us costs and wages.

12
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,670
Then this woman shows up,

13
00:00:40,056 --> 00:00:42,056
a lady, very well put together.

14
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:44,571
Joyful, talkative.

15
00:00:46,987 --> 00:00:49,987
She invited me to her office the next day.

16
00:00:51,297 --> 00:00:52,597
It was huge.

17
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,492
She had two whole buildings.

18
00:00:56,684 --> 00:00:59,184
One was a training center.

19
00:01:01,472 --> 00:01:03,972
She brought girls from the islands,

20
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:06,495
had them sleep there,


21
00:01:07,264 --> 00:01:12,264
poor girls, like chickens in cages,


22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,970
hundreds of them.


23
00:01:14,396 --> 00:01:17,396
When I visited they’d all stand up,

24
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:20,497
Yelling out, “good morning sir!”

25
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,372
A hundred voices shouting.

26
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,149
And you’d feel embarrassed…

27
00:01:25,888 --> 00:01:31,188
She’d also train them there, teach them what to do. 

28
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,100
Before they traveled --


29
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:34,869
she had a very strong personality --


30
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:39,714
they’d pass by her office on the way to the airport,

31
00:01:40,336 --> 00:01:44,336
and she’d give them a righteous lecture:

32
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:46,519
“You need to make the Philippines proud,

33
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,622
You need to be on your best behavior.”

34
00:01:48,973 --> 00:01:49,973
Etcetera.


35
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,908
So we began working with this woman.

36
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:56,682
Her name was Mary Mi.

37
00:01:57,704 --> 00:02:00,405
She sent us requests by the hundreds.
