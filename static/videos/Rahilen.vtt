00:00:03.591 --> 00:00:05.814 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
That's what I call it:

2
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.509 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
a market.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.508 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
It's a labor market.

4
00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:15.800 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
A market set up by human traffickers.

5
00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:19.385 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
It's like when you're selling sheep.

6
00:00:20.134 --> 00:00:22.586 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
Someone raises the sheep,

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.893 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
and then sells them,
to make a profit off the work they put in. 

8
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.648 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
But these agencies...

9
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.917 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
they don't even give you a drink of water.

10
00:00:31.287 --> 00:00:35.586 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
They don't raise you either,
feeding you the way a parent would.

11
00:00:36.392 --> 00:00:38.980 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
Worst of all, is that these traffickers

12
00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:41.644 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
buy and sell human beings,

13
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.980 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
without having had to put in any effort.

14
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.228 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
Because to sell sheep,

15
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.460 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
you've had to put in a certain effort
to raise them first.

16
00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:53.005 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
Without that work you'd get nothing.

17
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.900 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
And so how can it be that for something
as worthy of respect as a human being

18
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.281 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
whom they've made no effort to raise

19
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.197 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
or to provide with food and drink

20
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.632 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
they can put all this work into trafficking them?

21
00:01:05.894 --> 00:01:07.533 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
I can only be ironic

22
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.543 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
and say thank you.

23
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.774 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
There's nothing else you can say to them.

24
00:01:12.964 --> 00:01:15.029 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
Because they're dealing with human beings

25
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.776 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
destined to be sold like any other product.

26
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.090 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
Let's be very clear:
it's our own country that opened up this market.

27
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:28.365 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
Our own president who began
this trafficking business.

28
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.213 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
The state wanted to bring foreign currency,
dollars, into the country

29
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.340 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
and so they made it easy
for the mafias to traffic young girls.

30
00:01:38.435 --> 00:01:41.106 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
They've been buying and selling us for 21 years.

31
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.112 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
By us, I mean Ethiopian women.

32
00:01:44.425 --> 00:01:46.813 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
This sort of trafficking didn't exist before.

33
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.481 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
Ethiopians who came to Lebanon
did so to pursue university studies.

34
00:01:55.854 --> 00:01:58.960 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
When you come to a country like this one,

35
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.000 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
and you're leaving your country for the first time,

36
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.817 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
it's your heart that bleeds, truly.

37
00:02:05.785 --> 00:02:07.604 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
When I left my family,

38
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.042 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
my tears began to flow
the minute I got on the plane.

39
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.642 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
Because I started wondering:
where am I going?

40
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.768 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
What kind of people will I be dealing with?

41
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.437 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
What language will I use to communicate with them?

42
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.645 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
I prayed to God to keep me safe.

43
00:02:25.282 --> 00:02:27.468 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
I cried the whole way here.

44
00:02:27.885 --> 00:02:29.514 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
I was so young.

45
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.327 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
It was the first time I'd ever been separated
from my mother and father.

46
00:02:33.327 --> 00:02:35.320 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
It was very hard.

47
00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:38.743 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
As soon as I landed at the airport,

48
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.696 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
the first thing I heard were the shouts of policemen.

49
00:02:45.974 --> 00:02:48.640 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
We were all herded into one room.

50
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.977 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
There were so many of us.

51
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.635 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
Even if I didn't understand what they were saying
their rage was very clear.

51
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.171 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
They weren't treating us like human beings.

52
00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:00.597 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
We were shoved around.

53
00:03:00.816 --> 00:03:03.306 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
They told us go here, go there!

54
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.980 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
They were yelling at us, it was terrifying.

55
00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.250 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
I stared at the floor, the ceiling.

56
00:03:09.253 --> 00:03:12.737 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
I felt like I was suffocating in a great darkness.

57
00:03:13.117 --> 00:03:16.623 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
If these men are shouting so much, I thought,

58
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.678 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
then what will my employers be like?

59
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:22.816 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
Because these were the men
in charge of "security,"

60
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.988 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
of enforcing the laws of the state,

61
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.691 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
wearing its uniform.

62
00:03:28.248 --> 00:03:30.530 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
No one takes these facts into consideration.

63
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.977 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
No one listens to us.

64
00:03:34.925 --> 00:03:37.924 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
People say, 'things will get better with time.'

65
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.100 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
And this is what makes me angry.

66
00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:44.223 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
Of course things will change with time.

67
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.988 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
But no one sees us as human beings.

68
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:48.939 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
That's the fundamental thing.

69
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.303 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
Should it really take a person that long to evolve?

70
00:03:53.722 --> 00:03:57.161 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
Why should it take time to be seen as "human"
in the eyes of others?

71
00:03:57.768 --> 00:04:00.330 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
If technological advances can be made this fast,

72
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.059 line:13 position:50% align:center size:100%
then why should it take so long
to evolve as a person?
