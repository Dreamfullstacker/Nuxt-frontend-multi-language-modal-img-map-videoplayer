Chapter 1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
I went on a trip to India

Chapter 2
00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:05.107
The friend I work with there

Chapter 3
00:00:05.902 --> 00:00:08.403
brought me sacks full of passports

Chapter 4
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.391
actual sacks

Chapter 5
00:00:10.987 --> 00:00:12.987
with several thousand passports

Chapter 6
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.900
that he placed before me

Chapter 7
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.588
Certainly it was about who paid him most

Chapter 8
00:00:21.957 --> 00:00:23.757
Heâd come to the office in the morning

Chapter 9
00:00:25.184 --> 00:00:27.684
he had ash or drawings here

Chapter 10
00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:31.332
related to his religion

Chapter 11
00:00:31.893 --> 00:00:33.893
Heâd be painted orange here

Chapter 12
00:00:34.164 --> 00:00:35.362
with a thing on his head

Chapter 13
00:00:35.651 --> 00:00:36.850
and take a seat

Chapter 14
00:00:36.972 --> 00:00:38.972
And the people whoâd come see him

Chapter 15
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.530
would trust him more

Chapter 16
00:00:40.728 --> 00:00:45.030
Like a Hajj here, who has a beard, prays

Chapter 17
00:00:46.015 --> 00:00:48.015
he took advantage of this in his work

Chapter 18
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:52.941
Soâ¦ he was quite ruthless

Chapter 19
00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.289
If a girl came to him wanting to travel today

Chapter 20
00:00:56.917 --> 00:00:58.917
and paid more than the girl

Chapter 21
00:00:59.283 --> 00:01:01.283
already waiting 20 days

Chapter 22
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:03.631
sheâd travel immediately

Chapter 23
00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.319
So weâd match up the girlsâ¦

Chapter 24
00:01:06.694 --> 00:01:09.694
this one with that person

Chapter 25
00:01:10.128 --> 00:01:13.128
this same one with someone else

Chapter 26
00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:14.575
They were all here

Chapter 27
00:01:14.718 --> 00:01:17.718
but each using another womanâs passport

Chapter 28
00:01:18.483 --> 00:01:21.784
So that the one who paid most, traveled first

Chapter 29
00:01:22.287 --> 00:01:24.287
And he had connectionsâ¦

Chapter 30
00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:29.019
connections there at general security, the airport

Chapter 31
00:01:30.075 --> 00:01:34.075
everywhere related to the authorities

Chapter 32
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.046
And he didnât care

Chapter 33
00:01:36.575 --> 00:01:38.048
so long as he got paid
